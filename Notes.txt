Day 1

Why We use React : Application is fast, single page Application, (Having only one html page to build complete Application).
                    Ex : Instagram, FaceBook, GitHub


This is the process of passing the value between the JS File
let phone = "IPhone";
 export default phone;

import phone from "./India.js"
console.log(phone);



Scenario 1  : 
we must write the same name of resourse in export.
let phone = () =>{
    console.log("IPhone");
}
export default phone;


we can write the any name / Rename of resourse in import.
import Lava from "./India.js"
Lava();




Scenario 2  : 
We can pass the function , array, value, and anything 

we can not pass multiple value by : export default phone , Laptop;  
So we need to array or object to pass multiple export
2.1 Passing value by Array

let phone = () =>{
    console.log("IPhone");
}
let Laptop = "AsusX515"
export default [phone, Laptop];


import Resourse from "./India.js"
let [phone, Laptop] = Resourse;
console.log(Laptop);
phone();


2.2 Passing value By Object

let resourse1 = "Weapons"
let resourse2 = "Cruid Oil"

let obj = {
    resourse1,
    resourse2,
    func : ()=>{
        console.log("Function");        
    }
}
export default obj;


import India_Resourse from "./India.js"
let {resourse1, resourse2, func} = India_Resourse
console.log(resourse2);
func();
