Day 1

React is Liberary of JavaScript.

Why We use React : Application is fast, single page Application, (Having only one html page to build complete Application).
                    Ex : Instagram, FaceBook, GitHub


This is the process of passing the value between the JS File
let phone = "IPhone";
 export default phone;

import phone from "./India.js"
console.log(phone);



Scenario 1  : 
we must write the same name of resourse in export.
let phone = () =>{
    console.log("IPhone");
}
export default phone;


we can write the any name / Rename of resourse in import.
import Lava from "./India.js"
Lava();




Scenario 2  : 
We can pass the function , array, value, and anything 

we can not pass multiple value by : export default phone , Laptop;  
So we need to array or object to pass multiple export
2.1 Passing value by Array

let phone = () =>{
    console.log("IPhone");
}
let Laptop = "AsusX515"
export default [phone, Laptop];


import Resourse from "./India.js"
let [phone, Laptop] = Resourse;
console.log(Laptop);
phone();


2.2 Passing value By Object

let resourse1 = "Weapons"
let resourse2 = "Cruid Oil"

let obj = {
    resourse1,
    resourse2,
    func : ()=>{
        console.log("Function");        
    }
}
export default obj;


import India_Resourse from "./India.js"
let {resourse1, resourse2, func} = India_Resourse
console.log(resourse2);
func();

Day 3

Q1. what is the advantages andd DisAdvantages of React.
advantages : 1. Application become very faster and smooth
             2. Reduce the line of code to achieve code redundancy.
             3. Faster development 
             4. Easy to maintain
             5. Application become lightweight.

DisAdvantages : 1. We cannot achieve 100% SEO using SAP -> because it has only one html fie which can load the meta only once
                2. Application become costly because we need trained developers.



Q2. Difference between Single Page Application  and multiple page Application.



History : 
1. Angular FrameWork Found by Google in 2009. It is based on MVC architecture. It is Supporting JavaScript and TypeScript.

2. React Liberary Found by FaceBook in 2011. It is based on Component base architecture. It is Supporting JavaScript and TypeScript. 
    2011 -> Instagram
    2012 -> FaceBook
    2013 -> Launched

3. Vue FrameWork Found by Evan you in 2014. it is based on Component based architecture. It is Supporting TypeScript and JavaScript.

4. Angular2 FrameWork Found by Google in 2016. it is based on Component based architecture. It is Supporting only TypeScript.




Q3. what is diffing Algorithm : It is the process of finding the Difference between Real DOM And Virtual DOM.
Q4. What is Reconciliation  : Implementing the changes in Real DOM, that found during the Diffing Algorithm Virtual DOM.
Q5. What is react fiber :  React fiber is the react engine that handle all the internal working with the react like diffing Algorithm, Reconciliation and lot many things

Day 7

Component : Component is the reuseable block of code which is used to perform specific task.
            A Component represents single function or a class.
            A Component name should always start with UpperCase character.
            We can return jsx from an Component and that jsx is return to the caller.
            We can have multiple Components inside single module. But it is recommended to have only one.
            Component are divided into two types : 1. Function based Components.  2.Class based Component.

Q. Difference between Function based Component and class based Component



import { Component } from "react";
import Navbar from "./Component/Navbar";
import Aside from "./Component/Aside";
import MainBody from "./Component/MainBody";
import Footer from "./Component/Footer";
import Count from "./Day7/Count";



// class App extends Component{
//   constructor()
//   {
//     super();
//   }
//   render(){
//     return(
//       <div>
//         <Navbar/>
//         <div id ="mainBody">
//           <Aside/>
//           <MainBody/>
//           </div>
//         <Footer />  
//       </div>
//   )
//   }
// }



class Day7 extends Component{
  constructor(){
    super();
    
  }
  render(){
    return(
     <Count/>
    )
  }
}

export default Day7;
import { Component } from "react";

class Count extends Component{
     constructor(){
    super();
    this.state = {
      cartItem : 0
    };
  }

  render(){
    return(
      <div>
      <h1>{this.state.cartItem}</h1>
      <button onClick={()=>{
        this.setState({cartItem : this.state.cartItem +=1})
      }}>Like</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default Count;
